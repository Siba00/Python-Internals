# Python-Internals
This repository is part of an assignment for Software Design with Python [SDwP] course, in which we will try to exhaust all the characteristics of python.and it consists of five main tasks:
___________________________________________________________
# Task 1
In this task we are copmaring between  N arbitrary .py files and create a neat table out of their execution time starting with the fastest, and in order to test this task you should open the **main.py** file and run the following command in the trminal:

**$ python3 main.py task1 src1.py src2.py src3.py**

and you can check the results of the first task in the file **task1_output.txt**, and you can test your own  programs executions time and compare between them just make sure they are in the same directory.

______________________________________________________________
# Task 2
for this task we deined a functionun that yield opcodes (and their arguments) for ordinary python programs. In order to use function you need to copy the following command in your terminal and place our **.py** file(s) with yours:

**$ python3 main.py print -py src1.py**
 
and you can check the results of the first task in the file **task2_output.txt**
